# Relative velocity detection system

we are using the Computer vision-based object detection model for detecting vehicles in real-time.
Then find the distance of the object( Vehicle), using mathematical distance in the image. and this distance measurement runs in a  loop of some sec or milli sec.
After getting the vehicle distance over time, we can get the relative velocity of the object(vehicle) with which we can decide the probability of hitting the object based on the relative velocity.  
By this the driver will be able to know about his speed, the other vehicleâ€™s speed and the probability of getting himself into the accident.
